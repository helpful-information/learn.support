# What is Learn, Support?
Learn, Support. Information should be shared freely, let's help each other learn. 

## First party resources
 - [crisis.tools](https://crisis.tools) - A quick access resource for information you may want in a crisis.
 
 _(coming soon...)_
 - [learning.financial](https://learning.financial) - An open source tool for keeping you informed about your finances.
 - [learning.cheap](https://learning.cheap) - A collection of educational YouTube channels, playlists, websites, and other tools where you can learn things for little (<$1 USD) to no money.
 - [pending.download](https://pending.download) - A place where links to useful software live. Antiviruses, productivity apps, tools, etc... 

#### Useless ideas 
 - [fake.tools](https://fake.tools) - A useless place full of only ideas (until they're not).  

####### _Note_
None of the lists are promoted by, or for, anyone. 
I do not and will not accept money for putting links in these lists.
They're not fully comprehensive lists, nor are they only "the best". 
To put it in a No BS way, these are just lists with information to help guide you to a better answer, a way to give you the context and basic understanding of a topic.

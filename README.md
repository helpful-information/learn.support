# What is Learn, Support?
Learn, Support. Information should be shared freely, let's help each other learn.

The goal here is to spread _information_ that will be helpful. Not political views.

## Can I help
ABSOLUTELY! There are loads of useful sources that aren't listed yet, so if you know of any that aren't listed please [create an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) or [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!
